# Dot

Dot is a simple, dynamically-typed programming language built for learning about interpreters. The language is inspired by other popular languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, and aims to provide a modern, easy-to-use syntax for beginners and experienced developers alike.

This implementation of Dot is inspired from the amazing book 'Writing an Interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball. The book provides a step-by-step guide to building an interpreter for a programming language called Monkey. The Dot language is a modified version of Monkey, with additional features and improvements to the original language.

I plan to improve the interpreter gradually and add more features to it and probably build projects with
Dot like how Linus Lee did with his language _Ink_.

## Features

The following table showcases some of the features that have been implemented in Dot:
